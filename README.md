Bored@school is a website desgined by a student (who is a meganerd with way too much time on his hands) for fellow students!
No district will block the creation of a student, it's bad publicity! Bored@school is maintained and developed by Sirius-Development, a Houston-based high schooler who is dedicated to providing fellow students with fun and simple games for their free time in school!
